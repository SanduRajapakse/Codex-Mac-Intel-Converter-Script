# Codex App for Mac Intel (Unofficial)

Minimal helper repo to rebuild the official `Codex.dmg` into an Intel-compatible macOS app image.

This is an unofficial adaptation approach, similar in spirit to the Linux community port:  
[Codex App for Linux (unofficial)](https://github.com/areu01or00/Codex-App-Linux/)

## What is included

- `build-intel.sh` — main build script
- `.gitignore` — ignores build artifacts and local temp files
- `package.json` — optional convenience `npm` script wrapper

## Requirements

- macOS
- `bash`, `hdiutil`, `ditto`, `codesign`
- Node.js + npm (used by the script to fetch Electron/runtime dependencies)

## Quick usage

1. Put your original `Codex.dmg` next to the repo folder (not inside it), so it is available as `../Codex.dmg` (or place it in the repo root as `./Codex.dmg`).
2. Run:

```bash
chmod +x ./build-intel.sh
./build-intel.sh
```

Or:

```bash
./build-intel.sh /absolute/path/to/Codex.dmg
```

## Output

- `CodexAppMacIntel.dmg` — rebuilt Intel-targeted output
- `log.txt` — full build log
- `.tmp/` — temporary build workspace

## Notes

- DMG search order: explicit path argument → `../Codex.dmg` → `./Codex.dmg` → a single `.dmg` in the parent folder.
- npm cache is scoped under `.tmp/` during the build to avoid permission issues with `~/.npm`.

If you have problems, ask your current Codex :)
